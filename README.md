# Overview

In this project, I developed a mobile specification classification model using the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2, complemented by Azure AutoML for comparative analysis. The project involved creating an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that included data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, performance fine-tuning, and deployment—all within Azure’s scalable cloud environment.

I utilized Azure ML SDK v2 to build a manually optimized pipeline and compared its performance against an AutoML approach. The AutoML method achieved an weighted F1 score of 90%, while the manually optimized pipeline reached an impressive weighted F1 score of 97%. This comparison underscores the effectiveness of manual feature selection and model tuning in enhancing classification accuracy, demonstrating the advantages of tailored machine learning solutions over automated ones.
