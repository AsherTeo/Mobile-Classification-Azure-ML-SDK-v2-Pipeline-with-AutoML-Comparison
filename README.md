# Overview

In this project, I developed a mobile specification classification model using the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2, complemented by Azure AutoML for comparative analysis. The project involved creating an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that included data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, performance fine-tuning, and deployment—all within Azure’s scalable cloud environment.

I utilized Azure ML SDK v2 to build a manually optimized pipeline and compared its performance against an AutoML approach. The AutoML method achieved an weighted F1 score of 90%, while the manually optimized pipeline reached an impressive weighted F1 score of 97%. This comparison underscores the effectiveness of manual feature selection and model tuning in enhancing classification accuracy, demonstrating the advantages of tailored machine learning solutions over automated ones.

# Azure AutoML Implementation

## Step 1: Split Data

The dataset is divided into training (80%) and testing sets (20%). The training set is used for 5-fold cross-validation to ensure reliable model performance, while the testing set is reserved for final evaluation. 

## Step 2: AutoML Training

AutoML is trained on the training data with 5-fold cross-validation, evaluating multiple models. The parameters for AutoML include:

Featurization: TabularFeaturizationSettings(mode="Auto") \
Timeout: 15 minutes \
Trial Timeout: 2 minutes \
Max Trials: 40 \
Enable Early Termination: True 

## Step 3: Model Evaluation

The pipeline generates two outputs: the best model and the testing dataset. The best model is selected and evaluated on the test data, with performance measured using the weighted F1 score to assess classification accuracy.
